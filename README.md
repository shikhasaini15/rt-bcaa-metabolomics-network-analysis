"Mapping BCAA Metabolic Adaptations to Resistance Training in Aging Muscle: A Cytoscape-Based Network Analysis"

This project explores metabolic remodeling in aging skeletal muscle in response to resistance training (RT) using untargeted LC-MS metabolomics and network-based analysis in Cytoscape. The study focuses on branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and their integration with gene and enzyme networks to uncover coordinated biochemical changes and pathway adaptations.

# Key Features

Data: LC-MS metabolite profiles from 122 muscle samples (pre- and post-resistance training).

# Analysis:

Statistical processing with R (PCA, PLS-DA, fold change, FDR-corrected t-tests).

Pathway enrichment via MetaboAnalyst Mummichog.

Network construction in Cytoscape using the MetScape plugin to link metabolites, genes, reactions, and enzymes.

Correlation and partial-correlation (DSPC) networks to detect co-regulated metabolites.

# Findings:

Valine, leucine, and isoleucine increased post-training; N-acetyl-L-glutamate and succinic anhydride decreased.

BCAA metabolites showed tight co-regulation and increased hub connectivity in mitochondrial oxidation pathways.

Network visualization validates known BCAA pathways and highlights novel hypotheses for sarcopenia research.

# Purpose

This framework demonstrates a reproducible workflow for multi-omics network analysis, enabling integration of metabolite, gene, and enzyme data to identify biomarkers, explore pathway adaptations, and generate testable hypotheses in aging muscle and exercise biology.
